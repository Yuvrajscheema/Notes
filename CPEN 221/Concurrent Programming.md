- Multiple Threads:
	- Processing different bank account operations, what if 2 threads change the same account at the same time
	- Use a shared cache of recent files, what if 2 threads insert the same file at the same time
	- Creating pipeline with a queue for handling work to the next thread in sequence, what if enqueuer and dequeuer adjust a circular array queue at the same time
- Why Threads?
	- Code structures for responsiveness
	- Processor Utilization
	- Failure isolation
- Mutual Exclusion , on thread only works on one section e.g. one bank account
- We need a Lock, a java lock is an ADT
	- **new**, **acquire**, **release**
