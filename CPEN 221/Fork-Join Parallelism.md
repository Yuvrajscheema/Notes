- Parallelism: use extra resources to solve problem faster
- Concurrency: correctly and efficiently manage access to shared resources
# Parallelism
 - Use extra computational resources to solve a problem faster, increasing throughput via simultaneous execution
 - When using threads, you must start them `myThread.start();` or `threads[i].start();` 
 - If we want to check that a thread is complete, `threads[i].join();` this waits for the thread to finish
 - Join might throw a interrupted exception
 - There can be challenges with cross checking so we want to break the problem up so there is no cross boundary coordination, A thread should only work in items in its section
 - It is good to create threads based on the amount of available threads not just random numbers
 - Get number of available cores use `Runtime.getRuntime.availableProcessors`
 - If the work the threads have to do are not equal then we have load imbalance
 - We get bottlenecked by the slowest fucker
 - Use more threads so they have less to complete therefore the bottleneck will be smaller
 - To use a lot of threads use the ForkJoin framework
